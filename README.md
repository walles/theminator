# Theminator Theme Generator

This is the README for your extension "theminator-theme-generator". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

# TODO

- Generate UI theme
- Generate matching syntax theme
- Add a checkbox for using our theme or not. "Not" should fall back to whatever
  theme was in use before we started doing our thing. Or just some defaults if
  that's not possible.
- Regenerate theme when user updates color setting. Maybe with some flooding
  protection so we don't regenerate too often?
- Go through PRs and issues in
  <https://github.com/usernamehw/vscode-theme-generator> to see if there's
  something we also need to handle.
