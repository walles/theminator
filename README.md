# TODO

- Generate UI theme
- Generate matching syntax theme
- Add a checkbox for using our theme or not. "Not" should fall back to whatever
  theme was in use before we started doing our thing. Or just some defaults if
  that's not possible.
- Go through PRs and issues in
  <https://github.com/usernamehw/vscode-theme-generator> to see if there's
  something we also need to handle.
- Consider our name. "Theminator Theme Generator"?
